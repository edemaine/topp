* Number: 69
* Problem: Isoceles Planar Graph Drawing
* Statement:
Given a planar graph that is interior triangulated (all
interior faces are triangles), is there a staight-line
drawing of the graph such that each face is an isoceles
triangle (i.e., it has two equal-length sides)?

The problem is worth studying both when the drawing must
be planar (no crossings allowed) and when it is not.

If such drawings exist, then it is also worth studying what
grid-size is needed, and whether it can be done with integer
coordinates at all.  If such drawings do not always exist,
NP-hardness should be investigated.
* Origin: Joe Malkevitch at Graph Drawing '99.
* Status/Conjectures: Settled negatively in 2010: \cite{f-nipgd-10}.
* Partial and Related Results:
If the graph is a planar 3-tree (i.e., can be obtained
by starting from a triangle and repeatedly adding a
vertex of degree 3 inside a face, adjacent to all other
vertices in the face), then such a drawing can easily be
obtained by always placing the vertex at the centroid of
the face.  However, this drawing will in general be non-planar.

Of particular interest therefore, are planar graphs
of treewidth~4 and higher.

The problem was solved negatively in~\cite{f-nipgd-10}:
\emph{Theorem}:
``There exists an infinite class of maximal planar graphs 
that admit no isosceles planar drawing.''
Frati raises the new question of whether or not every triangulation
admits a possibly nonplanar isosceles drawing.
