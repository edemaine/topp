* Number: 9
* Problem: Edge-Unfolding Convex Polyhedra
* Statement:
Can every convex polyhedron be cut along its edges and unfolded
flat to a single, nonoverlapping, simple polygon?
* Origin: First stated in~\cite{s-cpcn-75}, but in
spirit at least goes back to Albrecht D\"urer~\cite{d-pm-1525}.
* Status/Conjectures: Open.
It seems to be a widespead hunch that the answer is {\sc yes}.
* Partial and Related Results:
The answer is known to be {\sc no}
for nonconvex polyhedra even with triangular faces~\cite{bdekms-upcf-03},
but has been long open for convex polyhedra~\cite{s-cpcn-75,o-fucg-00}.
