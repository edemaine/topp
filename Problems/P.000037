* Number: 37
* Problem: Counting Polyominoes
* Statement:
How many polyominoes on $n$ squares are there?
A \emph{polyomino} is a connected interior-disjoint union of axis-aligned unit
squares joined edge-to-edge, in other words, an edge-connected union of
cells in the planar square lattice.
The \emph{order} of a polyomino is the number of unit squares forming it.
The problem asks for the number of polyominoes of order $n$.
The key constraint here is that polyominoes must be edge-connected.
There are three variations on the problem, depending on whether two polyominoes
are considered equivalent by factoring out just translations
(fixed polyominoes), rotations and translations (chiral polyominoes),
or reflections, rotations, and translations (free polyominoes).
* Origin: To quote Klarner~\cite{k-p-97}:
``Polyominoes have a long history, going back to the start of the 20th
century, but they were popularized in the present era initially
by Solomon Golomb, then by Martin Gardner in his \emph{Scientific American}
columns.''
* Status/Conjectures: Open.
* Motivation: <none>
* Partial and Related Results:
Asymptotically,
results of Klarner et al.~\cite[Thm.~12.3.1]{k-p-97} show
that the number of fixed $n$-ominoes (factoring out just translations),
denoted $t(n)$, satisfies
$$\lim_{n \to \infty} [t(n)]^{1/n} = \lambda$$
(roughly, $t(n)$ is around $n^\lambda$)
for ``Klarner's constant'' $\lambda$,
with $4.0025 < \lambda < 4.5685$,
but the precise value of $\lambda$ remains open.
The lower bound of $>4$ is established in~\cite{brs-lambda4-16},
and the upper bound in~\cite{bb-ubp-15}.

The exact counts have been computed for small $n$.
See~\cite{s-oeis-A000105} for the number of fixed $n$-ominoes for $n \leq 28$
and for related references. 
The record was improved to $n=56$ by Jensen~\cite{j-cp-03} and most recently to $n=70$ by Barequet and Ben-Shachar~\cite{bb-cpr-24}.

* Related Open Problems:
There are many related problems involving 
polyominoes with restricted geometric shapes (e.g., \cite{s-oeis-A204804}),
polyiamonds (edge-to-edge unions
of unit equilateral triangles), polyhexes (edge-to-edge unions of unit
regular hexagons), polyabolos (edge-to-edge unions of unit right isosceles
triangles), polycubes (face-to-face unions of unit cubes), etc.
All of these problems are also open.
