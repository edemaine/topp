* Number: 27
* Problem: Hexahedral Meshing
* Statement:
Can the interior of every simply connected polyhedron whose surface is meshed
by an even number of quadrilaterals be partitioned into
a hexahedral mesh compatible with the surface meshing?~\cite{be-ecct-99}
* Origin: Uncertain.

* Status/Conjectures: Partially closed, Fall 2006.
* Partial and Related Results:
It was known that a topological hexahedral mesh
exists~\cite{m-cqmsw-96,e-lchmg-96},
with, in general, curved boundaries, but despite the availability of software
that extends quadrilateral surface meshes to hexahedral volume meshes,
it is not known if a "geometric" hexahedral mesh can
be achieved, with all cells having planar faces.

A new result~\cite{cs-cachm-06} settles the practical aspects
of the problem, but leaves one question unresolved.
This paper provides an explicit algorithm that extends a quadrilateral 
surface mesh
to a hexahedral mesh, where all the hexahedra have straight segment
edges.  
In a sense, these hexahedra are intermediate between the 
topological and geometric meshes mentioned above.
The faces are not necessarily planar, but this is not a
crucial aspect in applications, such a fluid dynamics simulations.

The question of whether a hexahedral mesh with planar faces
exists remains open.

described in Problem~\ref{Problem.28} to quadrilateral
and hexahedral meshes.
