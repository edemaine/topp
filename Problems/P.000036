* Number: 36
* Problem: Inplace Convex Hull of a Simple Polygonal Chain
* Statement:
How much extra space is required to compute the convex hull of a simple
polygonal chain or simple polygon in linear time?

More precisely, given the $n$ points in order along the chain in an array $A$,
the algorithm must re-arrange the points inplace in the array and output a
number $h$ so that the first $h$ elements in the resulting array are the points
on the convex hull in order.  The goal is to minimize the extra storage past
the array $A$, say to $O(\log n)$ or ideally $O(1)$.
* Origin: \cite{bikmm-oipcha-01}
* Status/Conjectures: Solved~\cite{bc-sacch-04}.
* Partial and Related Results:
From the abstract of \cite{bc-sacch-04}:
``we present a simple self-contained solution that uses $O(\log n)$ space, and indicate how to improve it to $O(1)$ space with the same techniques used for stable partition.''
%For computing the convex hull of a set of points,
%Br{\"o}nnimann et al. \cite{bikmm-oipcha-01} gave inplace algorithms using
%$O(1)$ extra space with running time $O(n \log h)$ for $h$ points on the
%convex hull, and running time $O(n)$ if the points have been presorted
%according to one coordinate.
