* Number: 63
* Problem: Dynamic Planar Nearest Neighbors
* Statement:
Is there a data structure maintaining a set of $n$ points in the plane
subject to
insertions, deletions, and nearest-neighbor queries in $O(\log n)$ time?
A \emph{nearest-neighbor query} asks to find a point among the set
that is nearest (in Euclidean distance) to a given a point in the plane.
This problem reduces to maintaining the convex hull of a set of $n$ points
in 3D subject to insertions, deletions, and extreme-point queries.
* Origin: Uncertain, pending investigation.
* Status/Conjectures: Open.
* Motivation:
This problem is the natural generalization of (1D) search trees to 2D.
Standard balanced search tree data structures can maintain $n$ points
on the real line
subject to insertion, deletion, and predecessor and successor queries
(and thus nearest-neighbor queries) in $O(\log n)$ time per operation.
(More sophisticated data structures even attain $O(1)$ time per update.)
* Partial and Related Results:
For 14 years, the authority on this problem was Agarwal and Matou\v{s}ek's
FOCS'92 paper \cite{am-dhsrr-95} which describes two data structures:
one suports updates in $O(n^\epsilon)$ amortized time and
queries in $O(\log n)$ worst-case time,
while the other suports updates in $O(\log^2 n)$ amortized time
queries in $O(n^\epsilon)$ worst-case time,
for any $\epsilon > 0$.
The nearest-neighbor problem is a decomposable search problem,
so when deletions are forbidden, the general techniques of Bentley and Saxe
\cite{bs-dsp1s-80} yield an $O(\log^2 n)$ amortized bound for updates
and queries.
In 2006, Chan \cite{c-dds3c-06} obtained the first polylogarithimc data
structure for 3D convex hulls and therefore 2D nearest neighbors.
His data structure supports insertions in $O(\log^3 n)$ expected
amortized time, deletions in $O(\log^6 n)$ expected amortized time,
and extreme-point or nearest-neighbor queries in $O(\log^2 n)$
worst-case time.
