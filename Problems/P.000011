* Number: 11
* Problem: 3SUM Hard Problems
* Statement:
Can the class of \emph{3SUM hard} problems
be solved in subquadratic time?
These problems can be reduced from the problem
of determining whether,
given three sets of integers, $A$, $B$, and $C$ with
total size $n$, there are elements
$a \in A$, $b \in B$, and $c \in C$ such that $a+b=c$.
* Origin: \cite{go-copcg-95}.
* Status/Conjectures: Open.

* Motivation:
Many fundamental geometric problems fall in this class,
e.g., computing the area of the union of $n$ triangles.
* Partial and Related Results:
$\Omega(n^2)$ lower bounds are known for 3SUM and a few 3SUM-hard
problems in restricted decision tree models of computation
\cite{es-blbda-95, e-lblsp-99, e-nlbch-99}.

3SUM and its obvious generalizations (4SUM, 5SUM, etc.) are examples
of \emph{linear satisfiability} problems.  A generic linear
satisfiability problem asks, given an array of $n$ integers, do any
$r$ of them satisfy the equation $$\alpha_1 x_1 + \alpha_2 x_2 + \cdots
+ \alpha_r x_r = \alpha_0$$ where $\alpha_0, \alpha_1, \alpha_2, \dots,
\alpha_r$ are fixed constants.  Erickson \cite{e-lblsp-99} proved an
$\Omega(n^{\lceil r/2 \rceil})$ lower bound for any problem of this type,
in the restricted linear decision tree model.  This lower bound is tight
except for a logarithmic factor when $r$ is even.
Ailon and Chazelle generalized Erickson's bound and
improve it for large $r$ or for more than $r$ variables~\cite{ac-lbldt-05}.

Baran et al.~\cite{bdp-sa3-05} show that subquadratic algorithms for 3SUM
are possible in common models of computation that allow more direct
manipulation of the numbers instead of just real arithmetic,
such as the word RAM.  The improvement they obtain is roughly quadratic
in the parallelism offered by the model; for example, with $\lg n$-bit words,
they obtain an $O(n^2 \left(\frac{\lg \lg n}{\lg n}\right)^2)$-time
algorithm.  With this word size, the 3SUM problem becomes whether any
improvement beyond polylogarithmic factors (or indeed, beyond
$\Theta(\lg^2 n)$) is possible.
