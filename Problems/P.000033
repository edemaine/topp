* Number: 33
* Problem: Sum of Square Roots
* Statement:
What is the minimum nonzero difference between two sums of square
roots of integers? 
More precisely,
find tight upper and lower bounds on $r(n,k)$, the minimum positive value of 
$$\left| \sum_{i=1}^k \sqrt{a_i} - \sum_{i=1}^k \sqrt{b_i} \right|$$
where $a_i$ and $b_i$ are integers no larger than $n$.
Bounds should be expressed as a function of $n$ and $k$.
Examples:
$$r(20,2) \approx .0002 = 
	\sqrt{10}+\sqrt{11}-\sqrt{5}-\sqrt{18}$$
$$r(20,3) \approx .000005 = 
	\sqrt{5}+\sqrt{6}+\sqrt{18}-\sqrt{4}-\sqrt{12}-\sqrt{12}$$
* Origin: 
Posed in~\cite{o-6369-81}. Perhaps older in other formulations.
* Status/Conjectures: Open, although some weak bounds are known.
* Motivation:
Of particular importance is whether $\lg 1/r(n,k)$ is bounded above by
a polynomial in $k$ and $\lg n$.  If this statement is true, then the
sign of a sum of square roots of integers can be computed in polynomial time.
If this statement is false, however, there still may be a polynomial-time
algorithm to compute the sign.

``A major bottleneck in proving NP-completeness 
for geometric problems is a mismatch
between the real-number and Turing machine models of computation:
one is good for geometric algorithms but bad
for reductions, and the other vice versa. Specifically, 
it is not known on Turing machines how to quickly compare a
sum of distances (square roots of integers) with an integer 
or other similar sums, so even (decision versions of) easy
problems such as the minimum spanning tree are not known to be in NP.''
* Partial and Related Results:
Exponential upper bounds are known through root-separation bounds
\cite{bfms-secsb-00, ms-gicsb-00}.  Specifically, 
\cite{ms-gicsb-00,bfms-secsb-00}
proves that $-\lg r(n,k) \leq O(2^{2 k} \lg n)$.  (More generally,
\cite{bfms-secsb-00, ms-gicsb-00} give finite algorithms to
compute the sign of algebraic expressions such as sums of square roots,
which are implemented and used in
\htmladdnormallinkfoot{LEDA}{http://www.algorithmic-solutions.com/enleda.htm}
and \htmladdnormallinkfoot{CORE}{http://www.cs.nyu.edu/exact/core/} for
exact geometric computation.)

John A. Anderson (\url{johnaa333@netzero.net}) has an unpublished proof
(Aug 2003) of a similar bound:
$$
r(n,k) \; \ge \; [4  k^2  n]^{1/2 - 2^{2k-2}} \;.
$$
%Note that, specializing to $k=2$ yields
%$$
%r(n,k) \; \ge \; [16  n]^{1/2 - 2^2}  = \Omega( 1/n^{7/2} ) \;.
%$$
Cheng et al.~\cite{cmsc-bssrl-09} establish an upper bound on $-\lg r(n,k)$
of $2^{O(n/\lg n)}\lg n$,
%~\cite{c-cssrs-06},
which improves on the above bound $O(2^{2k\lg n})$
whenever $n \le c k \lg k$ for some $c$.

At the other extreme,
Qian and Wang \cite{qw-nubdb-05} show an upper bound on $r(n,k)$
of $O(n^{-2k+\frac{3}{2}})$.
%Marc Glisse corrects that it is NOT tight for k=2.
%, and show that this is tight
%for many choices of $(n,k)$ (e.g., $r(n,2)=\Theta(n^{-\frac{7}{2}})$).
This upper bound on $r(n,k)$ implies a lower bound on $\lg 1/r(n,k)$,
that is, on how many bits we need to compute from the
square roots to determine the sign of the difference.
In particular, it settles (positively) a question posed here by Erik Demaine
(Nov. 2001): can the number of bits required to distinguish the difference
from zero ever exceed the total number of bits in the input integers?
%More precisely, are there integers
%$a_1, \dots, a_j, b_1, \dots, b_k$ for which
%$$
%-\lg \left(\sum_{i=1}^j \sqrt{a_i} - \sum_{i=1}^k \sqrt{b_i}\right)
% >  \sum_{i=1}^j \lg a_i + \sum_{i=1}^k \lg b_i + O(k)
%$$
%where the $O(k)$ term allows for roundoff error for small values?

A slight variation on the problem is to ask 
(e.g., for $k=2$), how close can
$\sqrt{a} + \sqrt{b}$ be to an integer; 
Dana Angluin and Sarah Eisenstat~\cite{ae-hc-04} proved
a bound of $\Theta(1/n^{3/2})$ on this integrality gap.

Related, \cite{b-csrpt-91} gives a polynomial-time Monte Carlo algorithm to
decide whether a sum of radicals is zero.
