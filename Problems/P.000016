* Number: 16
* Problem: Simple Polygonalizations
* Statement:
Can the number of simple polygonalizations of
a set of $n$ points in the plane be computed in polynomial time?
A \emph{simple polygonalization} is a
simple polygon whose vertices are the points.
* Origin: Uncertain, pending investigation.
* Status/Conjectures: Open.
* Partial and Related Results:
Marx and Miltzow~\cite{mm-pnc-16} give a planar-separator-based 
dynamic programming framework that, for any family of non-crossing 
straight-line graphs on an $n$-point set, counts those graphs in time 
$n^{(11 + o(1))\sqrt{n}}$. Since simple polygonalizations are exactly 
non-crossing Hamilton cycles, this framework yields an $n^{O(\sqrt n)}$ 
algorithm for counting them, improving on Alvarez and 
Seidel's~\cite{ar-saact-13} $O(n^2 2^n)$ bound for counting triangulations. 
Certain special cases are known (e.g., for
computing the number of
monotone simple polygonalizations~\cite{zssm-grpgv-96}),
but the general
problem remains open.  The problem is closely related to
that of generating a ``random'' instance of a simple polygon
on a given set of vertices, with each instance
being generated with probability $1/k$, where $k$ is the total number of
simple polygonalizations.
Heuristic methods are known and implemented~\cite{ah-hgrp-96}.
