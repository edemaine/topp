* Number: 3
* Problem: Voronoi Diagram of Lines in 3D
* Statement:
What is the combinatorial complexity of the Voronoi diagram
of a set of lines (or line segments) in three dimensions?
* Origin: Uncertain, pending investigation.
* Status/Conjectures: Open.
Conjectured to be nearly quadradic.
* Partial and Related Results:
There is a gap between
a lower bound of $\Omega(n^2)$ and an upper bound that is
essentially cubic~\cite{s-atubl-94} for the Euclidean case
(and yet is
quadratic for polyhedral metrics~\cite{bsty-vdhdc-98}).
A recent advance shows that
the ``level sets'' of the Voronoi diagram of lines, given by the union of
a set of cylinders,
indeed has near-quadratic complexity~\cite{as-pckum-00}.
* Related Open Problems:
This problem is closely related to Problem~\ref{Problem.2},
because points moving in the plane with constant velocity yield
straight-line trajectories in space-time.
