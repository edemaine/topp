* Number: 25
* Problem: Polyhedral Surface Approximation
* Statement:
How efficiently can one compute a polyhedral surface
that is an $\epsilon$-approximation of a given triangulated surface in
$\R^3$?
* Origin: Mitchell [?]
* Status/Conjectures: Open.
* Partial and Related Results:
It is NP-hard to obtain the minimum-facet surface
separating two nested convex polytopes~\cite{dg-ocop3-97a}, if they are allowed to have distinct structures; 
it is unknown if it is hard when one polytope is an offset of the other, e.g., if they arise as offsets of an underlying convex polytope
that we seek to approximate.
Polynomial-time approximation algorithms are known
(\cite{bg-aoscf-95,ms-sapo-95,as-sagp-98})
for this case, and for separating two terrain surfaces,
achieving factors within $O(1)$ or $O(\log n)$ of optimal.
However, no polynomial-time approximation results
are known for general surfaces.
