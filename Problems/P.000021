* Number: 21
* Problem: Shortest Paths among Obstacles in 2D
* Statement:
Can shortest paths among $h$ obstacles in the plane,
with a total of $n$ vertices, be found in
optimal $O(n + h \log h)$ time using $O(n)$ space?
* Origin: Uncertain, pending investigation.
* Status/Conjectures: Solved by Haitao Wang~\cite{w-naesp-23}, 
who gives an optimal $O(n + h \log h)$ time and $O(n)$ space algorithm.
* Partial and Related Results:
The first algorithm linear in $n$ in time and space was quadratic in 
$h$~\cite{kmm-eaesp-97}, after which Hershberger and Suri~\cite{hs-oaesp-99} 
gave an $O(n\log n)$ time algorithm using $O(n\log n)$ space.
Inkulu et al.~\cite{ikm-noafe-10} later found an $O(n + h\log h \log n)$ time 
and $O(n)$ space algorithm.
By modifying Hershberger and Suri's algorithm, Wang~\cite{w-spaop-21} 
reduced the space to $O(n)$ while the running time remained $O(n\log n)$.
Wang then closed the $\Omega(n + h \log h)$ lower bound by presenting the 
first $O(n + h \log h)$ time and $O(n)$ space algorithm~\cite{w-naesp-23}.

In three dimensions, the Euclidean shortest path problem among general
obstacles is NP-hard, but its complexity remains open
for some special cases, such as when the obstacles are disjoint unit
spheres or axis-aligned boxes; see \cite{m-gspno-00} for a survey.
