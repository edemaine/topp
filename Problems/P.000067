* Number: 67
* Problem: Fair Partitioning of Convex Polygons
* Statement: 
Define a \emph{fair partitioning} of a polygon as a partition of it into a
finite number of pieces so that every piece has both the same area and the
same perimeter.
If all the resulting pieces are convex, 
call it a \emph{fair convex partitioning}.
Given any positive integer $n$, can any convex polygon 
be convex fair partitioned into $n$ pieces?

If the answer is ``Not always,'' 
how does one decide the possibility of such a partitioning 
for a given polygon and a given $n$? 
And if a fair convex partition exists for a specific polygon,
how does one find a fair partitioning
that minimizes the total length of the cut segments,
or minimizes the sum of the perimeters of the pieces?

And finally, what could one say about higher 
dimensional analogs of this question?

* Origin: Posed by R. Nandakumar and N. Ramana Rao, June 2007.

* Status/Conjectures: Open. 
The originators tend to believe every convex polygon allows a
fair convex partition into $n$ pieces for any $n$.
There have been recent advances in 2010: 
Aronov and Hubard

\cite{ah-cevsa-10},
and independently Karasev
% http://arxiv.org/abs/1011.4762v2
\cite{k-esm-10},
have established the conjecture for any prime power, $n=p^k$.

* Partial and Related Results:

See~\cite{nr-fppi-08} for an introduction and survey and
proof that the conjecture holds for $n=2$, and
a proof for $n=4$.
The conjecture has been established for $n=3$ in~\cite{bbs-ec3-10}.

There is work on partitioning convex polygons into equal area convex pieces 
so that every piece equally shares the boundary of the given target polygon:

A proof
of a weaker result---that any polygon allows fair partitioning for any $n$
(where the pieces need not be convex) is proposed at
