* Number: 31
* Problem: Trapping Light Rays with Segment Mirrors
* Statement:
Is it possible to trap all the light from one point source
by a finite collection of two-sided disjoint segment mirrors?
A light ray is \emph{trapped} if it includes no point strictly
exterior to the convex hull of the mirrors.
The source point is disjoint from the mirrors.
Although several versions of the problem are possible, it
seems to make the most sense to treat the mirrors as open
segments (i.e., not including their
endpoints), but demand that they are disjoint as closed segments.
* Origin: O'Rourke and Petrovici~\cite{op-nlrm-01}.
The question seems natural enough to have been raised earlier, but no other
source is known.
* Status/Conjectures: Conjecture 9 from that paper: 
``No collection of segment mirrors can trap all the light from one
source.''
* Partial and Related Results:
In~\cite{op-nlrm-01} several other conjectures are formed that
imply a resolution to the posed problem.
The strongest---that no collection of mirrors as above can support
even a single \emph{nonperiodic} ray, i.e.,
one that reflects forever (so is trapped)
but never rejoins its earlier path---was disproved by
Ben Stephens in 2002, who designed
a construction of 8 mirrors that traps a ray reflecting 
nonperiodically.
A similar construction was discovered and described in~\cite{msz-tlram-12},
which also established that any finite number of rays can be trapped
nonperiodically.
Milovich~\cite{m-tlm-04} proved that if the angles between the lines
containing the mirrors are rational multiples of $\pi$,
then all but a countable number of light rays escape.
In his book on billiards, Tabachnikov says,
``It is unknown whether one can construct a polygonal trap
for a parallel beam of light''~\cite[p.~116]{t-gb-05}.
This is in contrast to known nonpolygonal traps for such beams.
